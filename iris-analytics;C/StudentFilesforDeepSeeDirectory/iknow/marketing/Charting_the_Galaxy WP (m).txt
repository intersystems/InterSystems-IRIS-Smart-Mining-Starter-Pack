THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY:
CHARTING THE GALAXY WITH THE GAIA SATELLITE
AND INTERSYSTEMS CACHÉ.
Abstract.
The European Space Agency (ESA) has chosen InterSystems Caché ® as
the database technology for the AGIS astrometric solution that will be
used to analyze the celestial data captured by the Gaia satellite.
The Gaia mission is to create an accurate phase-map of about a billion
celestial objects. During the mission, the AGIS solution will iteratively
re�ine the accuracy of Gaia’s spatial observations, ultimately achieving
accuracies that are on the order of 20 microarcseconds.
In preparation of the extreme data requirements for this project,
InterSystems recently engaged in a proof-of-concept project which
required 5 billion discrete Java objects of about 600 bytes each to be inserted
in the Caché database within a span of 24 hours. Running on
one 8-core Intel 64-bit processor with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5,
Caché successfully ingested all the data in 12 hours and 18 minutes, at
an average insertion rate of 112,000 objects/second.

Introduction.
Space missions are long-term. Generally 15 to 20 years in length, they require
robust long-term technologies for data processing, manipulation, and storage.
These technologies must also provide critical up-to-date processing feedback in a
timely fashion so that adjustments, if any, can be made rapidly to the spacecraft.
The Gaia mission is considered the biggest data processing challenge to date
in astronomy. As mentioned in an InterSystems press release in May 2010, the European
Space Agency (ESA) has selected InterSystems Caché ® to support part of
the scienti�ic processing associated with the Gaia mission.
InterSystems and the European Space Astronomy Center (ESAC) have been working
together since 2008 to see how InterSystems Caché can offer an advantage for
some or all of the Gaia processing needs, and to create an economical computing
architecture which can support the massive processing requirements of the Gaia
project.
The Gaia Mission.
The Gaia Satellite is scheduled for launch from French Guiana aboard a Soyuz-Fregat
in 2012. It will spend a couple of months traveling 1.5 million km from Earth
to L2, and spend the next 5 years scanning the entire sky. The goal: a phase-space
map of our galaxy.
With two �ields of view, a gigapixel focal plane and a radial velocity spectrometer,
the 2000 kg satellite is a complete surveyor. During its lifetime, Gaia will observe
1 billion sources approximately 80 times each.
In addition to astrometry and photometry for every source, Gaia will measure
spectra for approximately 150 million sources. Astrometric accuracies in the �inal
catalogue are expected to be on the order of 20 microarcseconds. Achieving this
accuracy requires extremely complex processing.
All Gaia data processing software is written in Java including the core astrometric
solution known as the Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS), which iteratively
re�ines the spatial accuracy of all the Gaia measurements. Since Gaia will be
spinning freely and making observations which relate only to other observations
made by Gaia, the collected data must be reduced in a self-consistent manner such
that all individual observations of celestial sources, the model of each source's
position and motion, and Gaia's own attitude, orbit, and velocity are in harmony.
Later, the entire system may be aligned with the International Celestial Reference
System (ICRS). It is the AGIS problem, about 10% - 50% of the entire Gaia processing,
for which InterSystems Caché has been selected.
The scienti�ic goals of Gaia are many-fold, but may be generally classed as unraveling
the structure and formation history of our Galaxy.
Technical Challenges and Requirements.
Gaia is expected to observe around 10 9 (that is, 1,000,000,000) celestial objects
passing its focal plane; for each celestial object, it is expected that Gaia will
observe about 100 attributes, totaling 10 11 (that is, 100,000,000,000) observations.
Of these, approximately 10% - 50% are expected to be used to construct a
global reference frame using AGIS. Once the data in the global reference frame is
calibrated and adjusted for attitude, it is used to update the positions and motions
of the other sources in the catalogue. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level work�low
of data �low between the Main Database and the AGIS Caché database.
FIGURE 1: HIGH-LEVEL WORKFLOW FOR AGIS EXTRACTION AND PROCESSING
It was previously estimated that the AGIS Caché database would contain the data
for roughly 100,000,000 sources (totaling 10,000,000,000 observations). The size
of this data was estimated to be in the order of 20 Terabytes. Recently, however, it
has been suggested that the AGIS Database could contain up to 500,000,000
sources (totaling 50,000,000,000 observations), yielding a 100 Terabyte database.
It is required that this data be ingested (or inserted) into the database within 7
days so that processing can begin immediately.
Once the data is ingested into AGIS, it is expected that around 40 iterations will be
required to fully calibrate and adjust the data, and it is required that this be complete
within 120 days. At the completion of the adjustment, the data from AGIS is
fed back into the Main Database, and the next cycle is initiated. This iterative processing
will continue for the life of the mission. Furthermore, the entire Gaia Data
processing is iterative – the improved positions from AGIS allow other processes
such as photometry and variability to get better results. These in turn are used to
improve the next AGIS solution.
Data Ingestion into the AGIS Caché Database.
The AGIS Data Model comprises several objects and is de�ined in terms of Java interfaces.
Speci�ically, AGIS treats each observation as a discrete AstroElementary
object. As Figure 2 illustrates, the AstroElementary object contains various properties
(mostly of the IEEE long data type) and is roughly 600 bytes on disk.
class AstroElementary {
long transitTimes[];
long transitTimeErrors[];
long HEALPIXID;
long HTMID;
double etaObs[];
double zetaRes;
double[] sourceParam;
double[] etaRes;
double zeta;
double zetaError;
float flux;
float fluxError;
float bg;
float bgError;
long id;
long telescope;
long ccdRow;
short pixelColumns[];
long detTime;
long detTimeError;
int typeFlag;
long sourceId;
}
FIGURE 2: THE ASTROELEMENTARY DATA MODEL.
In addition, the AGIS database contains several supporting indexes which are built
during the ingestion phase. These indexes assist with queries during AGIS processing,
and also provide fast ad-hoc reporting capabilities.
Using InterSystems Caché, with its Caché eXTreme for Java capability, multiple
AGIS Java programs will ingest the 100 Terabytes of data generated by Gaia
as 50,000,000,000 discrete AstroElementary objects. This data ingestion, plus
the building of supporting indexes, is required to be completed within 5 days,
yielding a required sustained ingestion rate of roughly 115,000 AstroElementary
objects per second.
Data Ingestion Proof-of-Concept.
As a proof-of-concept, InterSystems and ESAC, working together with NetApp engineers,
developed a test-bed to ingest 5 billion (5,000,000,000) AstroElementary
objects – roughly 10% of the overall data volume expected in the AGIS Database upon
completion of the mission. Per scale, this data would need to be ingested within 12
hours. However, due to non-production-grade hardware being used for this proofof-concept,
ESAC determined that the proof-of-concept would be declared successful
if this data were to be ingested within 24 hours.
Table 1 summarizes the speci�ications of the test system provided for this test:

TABLE 1: SUMMARY OF TEST SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.
Using the Caché eXTreme for Java capability, the test harness was able to ingest the
5,000,000,000 discrete AstroElementary objects in 12 hours and 18 minutes,
yielding an average sustained rate of 112,000 objects per second.

TABLE 2: SUMMARY OF RESULTS FROM INGESTION PROOF-OF-CONCEPT.
The test was considered exceptionally successful, especially since the inserts were
completed in almost 50% less time than the allotted 24 hours, with a nominal
system con�iguration.
Future ingestion tests will likely include multiple parallel ingestion programs,
thereby potentially further increasing the average ingestion rate, and reducing
the total amount of time for ingestion.
Conclusion.
In a proof-of-concept project conducted by the European Space Agency and
InterSystems, sample astrometric data was inserted into the InterSystems Caché
database at an average rate of 112,000 objects/second. The entire test was completed
in 12 hours and 18 minutes, just over half the allotted time of 24 hours,
using nominal test hardware. As a result, Caché continues to prove the right choice
as the database technology for the extreme data demands of the Gaia galaxy-mapping
satellite.
